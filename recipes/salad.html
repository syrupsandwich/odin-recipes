        <p>recipe by <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/260391/traditional-german-warm-potato-salad/" target="blank">Marianne (opens in new page)</a></p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 1/4 pounds waxy potatoes</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup hot vegetable broth</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Peel while still warm. Cut into thin slices and put in a large bowl. Add onion.</li>
            <li>Mix hot broth with vinegar, oil, salt, and sugar. Pour immediately over warm potatoes and onion; the potatoes need to still be warm so they can absorb the dressing better. Allow to stand for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
